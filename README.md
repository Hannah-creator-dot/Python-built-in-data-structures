# Python Built-in Data Structures Assignment

## Description
This assignment demonstrates the use of Python's built-in list data structure and common operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and indexing.

## Objective
- Learn how to create and manipulate lists.
- Practice common list methods in Python.
- Understand indexing and sorting operations.

## Instructions
1. Run the program using Python.
2. The script will:
   - Create an empty list.
   - Append elements (10, 20, 30, 40).
   - Insert the value 15 at the second position.
   - Extend the list with [50, 60, 70].
   - Remove the last element.
   - Sort the list in ascending order.
   - Find and print the index of the value 30.

## Example Output
```
Final List: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Index of 30: 3
```
